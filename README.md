# Loundon_Housing_Project_Springboard

In this data analysis project, average prices for 32 london boroughs between 1198 and 2018 has investigated.By analyzing this dataset, I answered these questions:

What were the most and least expensive boroughs in 2018?

How the housing prices in different boroughs changed over 2 decades?


For answering these questions, I mainly used Pandas library to convert CSV file to dataframe and then performed data assessing, cleaning and visualization. Data cleaning included droping invalid columns and  null values with zero. Different kinds of plots like bar and line plots were used to visualize data.
